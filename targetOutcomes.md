For this article you should focus on the findings reported for study 1 in section 2.2. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> In order to assess the claim that trustworthiness and warmth are highly similar trait judgements, we correlated the warmth ratings from the current study with the previously collected trustworthiness ratings (Sutherland et al., 2013; see Fig. 2). The correlation between trustworthiness and warmth was substantial and highly significant: r = 0.78, p < 0.001, n = 1,000. Similarly, in order to assess the claim that dominance and competence are highly similar trait judgements, we correlated the competence ratings from the current study with the previously collected dominance ratings (Sutherland et al., 2013). The correlation for dominance and competence was significant but only moderate in size: r = 0.32, p < 0.001, n = 1,000. The size of the correlation between trustworthiness and warmth was significantly greater than the size of the correlation for dominance and competence: ZPF = 15.46, p < 0.001, n = 1,000 (for further details on the statistical test see Raghunathan, Rosenthal, & Rubin, 1996). It therefore appears that trustworthiness and warmth facial judgments are indeed highly similar. In contrast, dominance and competence facial judgments are less strongly related (see Fig. 2).
